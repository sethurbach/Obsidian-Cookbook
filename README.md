## Overview
This is an Obsidian vault configuration I use for cooking. I’ve found it useful to store recipes, but has Obsidian offers the befit of creating visualizations link visualizations. Is there a point to keep track of your food this way? Not really, but it does look interesting. Data viz aside, the ability to query your recipe book is the biggest use I’ve gotten from this app. 
## Set Up
1. Download [Obsidian Notes](https://obsidian.md/download)
2. Download and extract this directory into the directory you want your vault in
3. Run Obsidian and open this directory as your vault
4. Set Template folder to the Templates folder
5. Open settings > Core plugins
6. Ensure Templates is enabled
7. Open settings > Templates
8. Set Template folder location to the Templates folder

## New Recipe
- Create a new recipe in the Recipe folder
- Insert Recipe - Template and fill out the recipe
- Link your ingredients to the recipe by surrounding the name with [[ ]] 
- Tag your ingredients to make use of Obsidian’s graph view
- Move the newly created ingredient to the Ingredients folder

## Graph View
Obsidian contains a graph view to visualize the links between your notes. You can use tags to your advantage to categorize your ingredients. This allows us to see a network of ingredients in our recipes. Not super useful, but it is fun.

Here is an example of a configuration you can have in graph view (on iPadOS):
